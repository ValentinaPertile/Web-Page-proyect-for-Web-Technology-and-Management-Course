# Space API Explorer 

A web application developed for the **Web Technology and Management** elective course. This project demonstrates the integration of third-party APIs with a focus on asynchronous JavaScript and modern CSS layout techniques.

##  Project Overview
The application provides a cosmic experience by fetching real-time data from space agencies and organizations. It was built to satisfy specific academic requirements, focusing on clean code and efficient API management.

### Key Features:
- **NASA APOD Integration:** Fetches and displays the "Astronomy Picture of the Day," including its description and title.
- **ISS Real-time Tracking:** Connects to the Open Notify API to retrieve the current latitude and longitude of the International Space Station.
- **Dynamic UI:** Features a random quote generator with dynamic CSS shadowing effects based on the selected quote.
- **Responsive Layout:** Built using **CSS Grid** for a sidebar-main content structure.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling and Grid Layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Fetch API, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
- **APIs:** - NASA Planetary API.
  - Open Notify (ISS Tracker).
